![Smart Boat 0183 TCP Integration](.github/smart0183tcp.png)

The **ha-smart0183tcp** integration lets **Home Assistant** receive real-time **NMEA 0183** data over TCP, enabling you to monitor wind, depth, speed, GPS, and other marine instruments directly in your dashboards. Perfect for **Raspberry Pi**-based central marine computers and boat automation projects.
